Damien walked into a crowded bar on a rainy Saturday evening. He took off his hood and scanned the area looking for his client. 
He noticed another man sitting alone in the corner of the bar with his head down. He went up to the bar, ordered a drink, and walked over to the man sitting in the corner. 
The mysterious man looked up at him, and as they made eye contact, Damien noticed that the man's eyes were glowing red.
